> ### ðŸš€ Floating and enhanced dmenu build  

### Patches

- Center dmenu
- Floating in the top of screen
- Search Highlight
- Lineheight
- More Colors
- Cleaner design (Removed '<' and '>')

### Installation

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/MiguelRAvila/CleanDmenu.git`
2. Run `cd CleanDmenu`
3. Run `sudo make install`
4. Now you can run it with `cldmenu_run` (you can use `-l 15` flag for the list style with 15 elements)  
5. ENJOY! ðŸš€

> In other to not interfer with the dmenu utility, the program will run with `cldmenu` in stead of `dmenu`.

### Customization

> #### ðŸŒŸ You can customize the *width*, *font* and *colors* in the `config.h` file.

##### Colors:

You can modify colors here (line 10), I wrote some comments for an easy change. Note: By default It has the Miramare color scheme.

##### Width:

In line 3: `static int min_width = 400;` You change the numeric value for a different width

##### Font:

In line 6: `"Proxima Nova:size=11"` You can change the font and size.
